# New-NFL-Kickoff-Data-Analysis
Now that the new NFL kickoff has gone though a full season, I want to look at how it has impacted the game.
# What Changed?

First, We have to define what changed about the NFL Kickoff between 2023 and 2024.  The nfl made these changes due to "unnacaptably high" injury rates on the old play, as well as the record lack of returns that occured in the 2023 season. 

From the NFL's operation website, the changes to the rule are listed as follows:

# Alignment
- All kicking team players other than the kicker will line up with one foot on the receiving team’s B40 yard line
- Kicker cannot cross the 50-yard line until ball touches the ground or player in landing zone or end zone
- The 10 kicking team players cannot move until the ball hits the ground or player in the landing zone or the end zone
- The receiving team will line up as follows:
    - Setup Zone – a 5-yard area from the B35 to the B30 yard line where at least 9 receiving team players must line up
    - At least 7 players with foot on the B35 yard line (restraining line) with alignment requirements (outside numbers, numbers to hashes, and inside hashes)
    - Players not on the restraining line must be lined up in setup zone outside the hash marks
- All players in the setup zone cannot move until the kick has hit the ground or a player in the landing zone or the end zone
- A maximum of 2 returners may line up in the landing zone and can move at any time prior to, or during, the kick

# Landing Zone

- Landing zone is the area between the receiving team’s goal line and its 20-yard line.
- Any kick that hits short of the landing zone – treated like kickoff out of bounds and ball spotted at B40 yard line; play would be blown dead as soon as kick lands short of the landing zone
- Any kick that hits in the landing zone - must be returned
- Any kick that hits in the landing zone and then goes into the end zone – must be returned or downed by receiving team – if downed then touchback to B20 yard line
- Kick hits in end zone, stays inbounds - returned or downed – if downed then touchback to B30 yard line
- Any kick that goes out of the back of the end zone (in the air or bounces) – touchback to B30 yard line

# Research Questions

- Did the new rule lead to more returns?
- Did the new rule lead to less injuries?
- How do the average starting field position of returned kicks compare with touchbacks? Is there more of an advantage to the kicking team to force a return?
- How does the average starting field position affect the amount of points scored on that drive?
